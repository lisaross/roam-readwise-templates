# Summary
    After organizing, highlighting, and bolding the highlights, create a high-level summary #[[Progressive Summarization]]
    What are the key ideas?
    How can I apply this knowledge that I learned?
    How do these ideas relate to what I already know?
# [[ðŸ’¡Ideas]]
    Note: Each idea should at least have a tag for the source page for better remixing
# [[Transient]]
    Note: Conceptual notes that aren't as tied to the source material. These are fodder for processing into evergreen notes.
# [[ðŸ“šLiterature Notes]]
    Note: Commentary on the book or things you don't want to forget. Maybe for use in a public mind garden. Should have a visible source reference. These are "weakly evergreen" because they're tied heavily to a single piece. Must be in your own words. These should be processed into Evergreen notes, or used as fodder for them.
    ""Literature notes", titled after a single work and meant primarily as linkages to other more durable notes, and as targets for backlinks. I write these roughly as "outline notes," except for someone else's ideas."
