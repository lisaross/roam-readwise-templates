# Roam Readwise Templates

Thanks to [[RoamStack]] for his [inspiration here](https://roamstack.com/feed-roam-using-readwise/), creating templates for Readwise that pull good metadata into Roam Research for books, articles and other resources funnelled through their service.

Readwise can pull highlights and notes in from multiple services. I use the following integrations:
- Books highlights and notes: Amazon Kindle and Apple Books
- Highlights and annotations (pdf and web via Chrome Desktop): Memex
- Read Later highlights and notes: Instapaper
- Article highlights: Medium
- Newsletter highlights: Matter
- Highlights and notes on RSS Feeds and Youtube Subscriptions: Inoreader
- Highlights and notes on iOS: Command Browser
- Twitter posts and threads
- Key highlights of podcasts: Airr

Readwise also allows imports from more manual sources like:
- OCR (via mobile app)
- PDF
- Email
- Freeform input

## Installation

Head to the [Roam Export](https://readwise.io/export/roam/preferences) config page and paste the specific templates into their areas. Documentation sprinkles the page throughout in case you want to learn more or customize to your needs.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. I've thrown up an issues page in case you have things you think I'd benefit from or errors you've found and have solutions for. Happy to make this collaborative! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
